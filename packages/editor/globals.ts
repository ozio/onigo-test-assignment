We are happy to introduce you our poorly coded and visually outdated markdown (ha-ha) editor!

It can:
1. Do lists (ordered and unordered).
2. Do simple markup, like *this*, __that__ and even ***both***.

It cannot:
- Do nested lists.
- Escape special markdown characters.

Enjoy!

_Yours sincerely, Nikolay_
