We're happy to introduce you our poor programmed and outdated looking markdown (ha-ha) editor!

It can:
1. Do lists (ordered and unordered).
2. Do simple markup, like *this*, __that__ and even ***both of them***.

It cannot:
- Escape markdown special characters.
- Provide nested lists.
- Deal with broken Markdown.

_Yours sincerely, Nikolay_
